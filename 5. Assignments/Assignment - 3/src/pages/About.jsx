      <h1>About this Project</h1>
      <p>
        This single-page application was built for a React assignment to simulate
        real features you would find in a student management and shopping portal.
      </p>
      <p>
        It covers everyday concepts such as conditional greetings, profile cards, live
        form updates, product tables, API calls with loading and error states, and
        navigation with nested routes using <code>react-router-dom</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can use this codebase as a starting point for a real college portal, adding
        authentication, backend integration, and your institute&apos;s branding on top.
      </p>
    </div>
